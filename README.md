Texas Tech Database Project for CS4354 in SQL

Group Project for CS4354 Databases


Project Description:

"In order to help Texas Tech keep track of departments, instructors, students and courses our group has developed a database to keep track and organize information from rNumbers to a department's physical address. We broke this up into five main tables which we will cover in the next slides. Most of the relationships we saw when conceptually breaking down this problem were One-to-many or Many-to-many. Such as an instructor having one department but a department having many instructors, or many students to many courses."
